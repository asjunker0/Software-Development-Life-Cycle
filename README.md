# CS250-SDLC
CS 250: Software Development Life Cycle
<br/>
<br/>(From the SNHU CS-250 Syllabus)
<br/>Students will explore the stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) through the lens of developers and testers to examine the characteristics, documentation, and purpose of each stage. Through applying SDLC stages within an agile development environment, students will learn the principles and best practices used to develop high quality software while also assessing the impact of communication, documentation, and ethics on the SDLC.

# Course Competencies
This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills relevant to the field:
<br/>
<br/>CS-20409: Explain the different methodologies and stages involved in the software development life cycle
<br/>CS-20410: Apply the stages of the software development life cycle within an agile development environment
<br/>CS-30411: Evaluate various software development methodologies and tools

The Sprint Review and Retrospective pulls together the Agile and Scrum practices that I have applied throughout this course.

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs can start through several methods such as interviews, surveys, focus groups, observation, and usability testing.
These methods gather insight from the users perspective to help the team understand goals and preferrences. 
With these goals and preferrences we can identify requirements to categorize by priority.
User stories are descriptions of a feature from the end user's perspective, usually following the format: “As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [reason].”
User stories clarify user needs and provide context for why a feature is important. 
This creates a focus on completing a users need instead of completing just the technical requirements.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
To develop a program we need to know the programs goals. 
From there we gather the users requirements to guide the development while staying aligned with their expectations.
We prioritize features by the users input then we can start development.
Development can be structured utilizing agile processes like scrum.
Scrum contains events in each sprint, such as the sprint planning, daily stand-up, development work, sprint review and sprint retrospective.
when utilizing scrum the team maintains a rhythm while delivering the most valuable work thoughout the process.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member prioritizes communication. Clear and open communication allows for ideas, feedback, and concerns to be discussed in an open environment.
A good team member also collaborates with their team and posesses the adaptability to approach challenges in a changing environment.
Besides those traits it is important to have accountability to be responsible and dependable. In software development technology is always changing, so it might also make a good team member if we stay curious and pursue new knowledge. <br/>
In any environment, to top it off, it is important to be respectful and kind to everyone.<br/>
These traits make a good team member for delivering successful projects while maintaining a healthy environment.
