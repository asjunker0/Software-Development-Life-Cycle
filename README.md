# CS250-SDLC
CS 250: Software Development Life Cycle

The Sprint Review and Retrospective pulls together the Agile and Scrum practices that I have applied throughout this course.

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?


# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?


# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
